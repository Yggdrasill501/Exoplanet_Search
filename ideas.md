# Ideas and logic to add
    - create class for trying to find exoplanet automaticly
    - create method/function that will try to find it on the spectrum by prolonging the days period
    - write automation for getting data from [MAST](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html)
    - write a checker for already found stars from [exoMast](https://exo.mast.stsci.edu/)
