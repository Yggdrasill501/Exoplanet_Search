# Exoplanet Search
## Concept
Concept is to create script that will help astronomers help to 
extract data and find exoplanets from frames and pictures
of stars in time.

## Idea
The idea is to write script that will take data from NASA 
database, Juliet and Lightcurve api. Then write some general
algorithm that process picture or data sets of stars than,
then search for exoplanets in data and return if there is
or there is not exoplanet.  

## Expected result
The expected result is to have functional code, with few 
examples of exoplanets found. Write report in Jupyter
or Deepnote.

## Nice to have
Create some simple app with simple UI. Create UML sheet
that will describe how the code works. Make it with 
the smallest computing capacity as possible.
